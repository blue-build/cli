# BlueBuild

BlueBuild's command line program that builds Containerfiles and custom images based on your recipe.yml.

## Installation

### Cargo

This is the best way to install as it gives you the opportunity to bulid for your specific environment.

```bash
cargo install --locked blue-build
```

### Podman/Docker

This will install the binary on your system in `/usr/local/bin`. This is only a `linux-gnu` version.

```bash
podman run --rm registry.gitlab.com/wunker-bunker/blue-build:latest-installer | sudo bash
```

## How to use

### Templating

Once you have the CLI tool installed, you can run the following to pull in your recipe file to generate a `Containerfile`.

```bash
bb template -o <CONTAINERFILE> <RECIPE_FILE>
```

You can then use this with `podman` or `buildah` to build and publish your image. Further options can be viewed by running `bb template --help`

### Building

If you don't care about the details of the template, you can run the `build` command.

```bash
bb build ./config/recipe.yaml
```

This will template out the file and build with `buildah` or `podman`. 

#### Local Builds

##### Rebase

If you want to test your changes, you can do so by using the `rebase` command. This will create an image as a `.tar.gz` file, store it in `/etc/blue-build`, an run `rpm-ostree rebase` on that newly built file.

```bash
sudo bb rebase config/recipe.yml
```

You can initiate an immediate restart by adding the `--reboot/-r` option.

##### Upgrade

When you've rebased onto a local image archive, you can update your image for your recipe by running:

```bash
sudo bb upgrade config/recipe.yml
```

The `--reboot` argument can be used with this command as well.

#### CI Builds

If you're running in Gitlab CI, it will automatically sign your image using Gitlab's own OIDC service. Here's an example of a `.gitlab-ci.yaml`:

```yaml
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS && $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
      when: never
    - if: "$CI_COMMIT_TAG"
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS"
      when: never
    - if: "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH"
stages:
  - build
variables:
  ACTION:
    description: "Action to perform for the pipeline."
    value: "build-image"
    options:
      - "build-image"
build-image:
  stage: build
  image: registry.gitlab.com/wunker-bunker/blue-build:alpine
  retry: 2
  rules:
    - if: $ACTION == "build-image"
  parallel:
    matrix:
      - RECIPE:
          - recipe.yml
  id_tokens:
    SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN:
      aud: sigstore
  script:
    - bb build --push ./config/$RECIPE
```

Support was also added for building in GitHub! You can use this tool instead of the standard GitHub Actions by using the following `.github/workflows/build.yaml`:

```yaml
name: build-ublue
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "30 16 * * *"
  push:
    branches:
      - live
      - template
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      - "**.md"
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  ublue-build:
    name: Build Ublue Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      id-token: write
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        recipe:
          - recipe.yml
    steps:
      - name: Maximize build space

      - name: Build Image
        env:

          PR_EVENT_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
          REGISTRY_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        run: |
          bb build --push ./config/${{ matrix.recipe }}
```
